Project 5 Readme

I have worked on this project by myself.  Currently it runs fairly well.  All of the necessary options
work properly.  The program will automatically start in non-verbose non-interactive mode and will read
any files passed to it through the command line or through a pipe.  Within the file you will find 8 
source files and a Makefile as well as this readme.  

The files are pr5.c and pr5.h which contains the main function and largely just parses the command line
options and reads input.

The pr_table.c and pr_table.h files contain the linked list implementation as well as some functions to 
add, delete, and initalize the list.  There is also a function that will return the pid of the current
foreground process.  The main bug with the linked list is that after a new process is forked the pid
is properly inserted into the process table like it should.  The problem lies when the function returns
to the calling function, which is execute_line in the parse.c file.  After the function returns and the
execute_line function returns to the main loop the process is not located within the process table if you
were to type in pjobs.  I do not know why it does this and i have no idea how to go about fixing it.

The pr_parse.c and pr_parse.h files are where i spent the majority of my time.  These files take the line
of input from the main function, tokenize it, fork a new child and pass it to the execvp function.  The 
majority of the work is done here.  Everything works properly like it should, still the only bug is when
the pid is inserted into the table.  If you enable verbose mode you will see after fork is called the 
process appears to be in the table, but if you run pjobs then the pid is nowhere to be found.

The pr_signal.c and pr_signal.h files just contain the signal installation function as well as some 
signal handler for the SIGCHLD and SIGINT signals.

The pr5.h file contains all of the macros used by the program.
